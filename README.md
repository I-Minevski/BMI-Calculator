# BMI-Calculator
Simple BMI calculator built with Python

This is a simple command-line application written in Python that allows the user to calculate their BMI (Body Mass Index) using either Metric or Imperial units.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `bmi_calculator.py` file.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the `bmi_calculator.py` file.
3. Run the following command to start the program: `python bmi_calculator.py`

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose your preferred unit system and enter your weight and height.

## Functionality

The program contains two functions for calculating BMI based on the selected unit system:

- `calculate_bmi_metric(weight, height)`: Calculates BMI using Metric units (kg and cm).
- `calculate_bmi_imperial(weight, height)`: Calculates BMI using Imperial units (lbs and ft'in' format).

The program also includes a `while` loop to ensure the user selects either Metric or Imperial as the unit system, and to handle any invalid inputs.
